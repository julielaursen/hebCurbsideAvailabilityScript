Perhaps you have already read some of these articles, but maybe they will help.

First, let’s review. If you want to pick up your HEB groceries curbside, you go to this website:
https://www.heb.com/static-page/heb-curbside-delivery?searchredirect=curbsidedelivery
You scroll down a bit to where it says “Curbside Pickup”.

From their main website, here are the steps you would take to manually prepare an online curbside pickup:
1. Navigate to https://www.heb.com/static-page/heb-curbside-delivery?searchredirect=curbsidedelivery
1. (Optionally) Log in or Register if you want to.

1. Look next to where it says “Curbside at...”. Verify this location is correct. If it is not, click the down arrow.
1. Make sure the window still says “Curbside” at the top.

1. Then click “Change Store” at the right.
1. Enter your zip code and select the store you want to pick up from.
(Sidenote: When I did this, the first 2 did not say “Free Pickup”, except today and tomorow. 
In order to get no charge, it seems you need to pickup on the 3rd to 5th week after ordered, no matter what the order or size that the store is.)

1. In the next screenshot it shows all of the remainder of times left for today, which have an additional charge of $4.95. Choose an available time. Some are free pickups.
1. Then hit the “Schedule Curbside” button at the bottom to place the order.
1. In theory, you’ll eventually get a text message stating that the order is ready to be picked up.

The following 2 articles have a URL link, https://curbside.howard.pro/, but it says it’s not secure when I click on it. I did not proceed.

This is the error:

Sometimes the lack of certificate(s) is simply the easiest / fastest / cheapest way to go and it still works legit.

[The second article above](https://sanantonioreport.org/san-antonian-creates-tool-to-pinpoint-h-e-b-curbside-service-slots/?/) explains fully the situation:

“Shortly after posting the tool, Howard began getting flooded with feedback – both from users applauding the tool and from users questioning the legality of it. 

> “When a user goes to heb.com there might be an implied acceptance of a contract by the user – in this case there might be an implication that the user would use heb.com in accordance with its [Terms of Use](https://www.heb.com/terms),” 
commented one Reddit user with the screen name Enroxorz. 
> “Now, whether HEB cares or not is up to them, but if they do they can bankrupt [Howard] with legal proceedings if [he] does not adhere to the cease and desist that *may* happen.”

H-E-B’s terms of use require users to get written consent before they “mirror any portion of the Service, or otherwise incorporate any portion of the Service into any product or service.”

Most website owners and API owners do not want someone to use their APIs without knowing how he or she is going to use them, said San Antonio attorney Stephanie Chandler. Chandler specializes in business law and intellectual property. 

The collection of data may have value and they don’t want a competitor to piggyback off the value they created, Chandler explained. The safest way for a data miner to access information without the potential of a lawsuit is to ask a business before accessing their API, Chandler said. 

Chandler said:
> “The best-case scenario is always if someone reaches out to the correct people at a business if 
> they want to develop functionality that ties into their web-hosted applications. This 
> allows for the data to cleanly flow, maintain accuracy and avoid issues.”

H-E-B customers can always visit heb.com and type in a zip code to see which stores near them have available time slots, Bedingfield said.  

The company declined to comment further on Howard’s search application.

Howard said he’s not worried about the legality. A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in affirming an injunction granted to analytics company HiQ against professional networking site LinkedIn, [said in September](https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20859399/linkedin-hiq-data-scraping-cfaa-lawsuit-ninth-circuit-ruling) that scraping data from a website doesn’t violate anti-hacking laws as long as the data is public.

The courts have yet to decide the merits of the litigation, however, and the 9th Circuit judges noted that LinkedIn could seek other legal remedies. In addition, a final ruling in this case might not apply to Texas. Still, Howard said this case gave him confidence he wasn’t doing anything illegal.

The positive feedback Howard has received has been very moving, he said, and made him feel he’s done something to help the community.

Howard said:

> “The most touching comment I received was from a woman on Reddit who is a pregnant 
> immunosuppressed person. She said to me, ‘This tool may have saved my life’ – it’s 
> been a lot of that, a lot of positive messages.” 

As a freelance developer, Howard said he’s probably written 500-plus data mining tools and hopes this tool will help his fellow Texans during the pandemic. 

Howard said “H-E-B’s curbside service 
> helps maintain social distance, and I’m glad to help people get access to its services.”
